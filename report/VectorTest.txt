[ PASS ] : stringVec is of type Vector<string>

3. Test on Default Constructor <Date object type>
[ PASS ] : dateVec is of type Vector<Date>

4. Test on Default Constructor <Time object type>
[ PASS ] : timeVec is of type Vector<Time>

5. Test on Default Constructor <WindLogType object type>
[ PASS ] : windLogVec is of type Vector<Date>

6. Test on Default Constructor member variables (Capacity)
[ PASS ] : Default constructed vector capacity at 2

7. Test on Default Constructor member variables (Used Slot)
[ PASS ] : Default constructed vector used slot at 0

8. Test on Default Constructor member variables (array pointer)
[ PASS ] : Default constructed vector array pointer not pointing to nullptr

9. Test on Adding unsigned value to unsignedVec
[ PASS ] : unsigned Vector return true after added value 12

10. Test on Getting value by index on unsignedVec
[ PASS ] : unsigned Vector contains value 12 at index 0

11. Test on passing unsignedVec into a Copy Constructor
[ PASS ] : anotherUnsignedVec's capacity has been deep copied from referencing unsignedVec
[ PASS ] : anotherUnsignedVec's used slot has been deep copied from referencing unsignedVec
[ PASS ] : anotherUnsignedVec's has a different address pointer as unsignedVec
[ PASS ] : anotherUnsignedVec's has the same value at index 0 been copied from unsignedVec
[ PASS ] : anotherUnsignedVec's has the same value at index 0  as unsignedVec, with a different address storing the value

12. Test on Overload equals operator with unsignedVector been set equals to thirdUnsignedVector
[ PASS ] : thirdUnsignedVector's capacity has been deep copied by using overload equals operator been set with unsignedVec
[ PASS ] : thirdUnsignedVector's used slot has been deep copied by using overload equals operator been set with unsignedVec
[ PASS ] : thirdUnsignedVec's has a different address pointer as unsignedVec
[ PASS ] : thirdUnsignedVector's value at index 0 has been deep copied with unsignedVec
[ PASS ] : thirdUnsignedVector's has the same value at index 0  as unsignedVec, with a different address storing the value

13: Scenario Test, [Adding 2 elements into the dynamic array]
[ PASS ] : Space has been allocated to 4 spaces after adding 2 elements
[ PASS ] : Space used is 2 after adding 2 elements
